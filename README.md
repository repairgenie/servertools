# servertools

Various scripts for managing things on your linux server that I vibe-coded using Google Gemini. These were created to solve problems I was facing, and to help maintain my servers better. As I create more, I will add more. If you have questions, I first suggest pasting the code into an AI like Gemini to ask it questions about the script.
